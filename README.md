## Project Introduction

The objective of this project is to automate the extraction and structuring of vape product data from two e-commerce websites. The focus is on 
transforming unstructured product descriptions into a structured schema suitable for data analysis, product comparison, or downstream  applications.

##  Approach

### 1. Web Scraping using Selenium

  Approximately 100 vape product listings were scraped from each of two websites using Selenium. The scraping process targeted key product attributes, including:

  a. Product name

  b. Product description

  c. Key features

  d. Product link

  e. Image URL

  The extracted information are stored in CSV format for subsequent processing. (vaperanger.csv and vagewholesaleusa.csv)

  ### 2. Feature Extraction using a Large Language Model (LLM)
     
  To derive structured data from the scraped product descriptions, a Large Language Model was employed. The approach involved:

  a. Defining a Pydantic schema (VapeProducts) to represent structured fields such as brand, model type, flavor, puff count, nicotine strength, battery capacity, and coil type.

  b. Creating a prompt template that instructed the LLM to extract these attributes in a valid JSON format.

  c. Utilizing LangChainâ€™s OutputFixingParser to enforce schema compliance and handle any formatting inconsistencies.

  d. Iterating through the product descriptions and applying the LLM pipeline to extract structured outputs, which were saved as a JSON file.

The extracted product features are stored in the structured_output.json file present in the repository.
